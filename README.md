# Astro-uConsole-

Astro-uConsole is an open-source project that transforms the ClockworkPi uConsole into a fully standalone, handheld astrophotography control system.

The goal is to provide a reliable, offline-capable, and fully integrated environment for controlling telescope mounts and astrophotography accessories using industry-standard open-source software.
